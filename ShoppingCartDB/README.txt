README for The database management systems project
========================================================================================

This is an online shopping cart system.
The code included here is a first draft, saved online as a backup in case i mess something up in my dev environment

SOME IMPORTANT NOTES:

** This runs off of the LAMP/WAMP/MAMP/XAMPP stack.  Put the entire folder into the htdocs or www folder and then 
	start the servers and run the project.

What is not working in this draft:

1. The user payment verification is not working  (because there is no code to make it work)
2. Ratings are displayed only on the laptops page
Files:

- index2.php, Laptops.php, Mobiles.php : Pages that contain the code for the all the three categories of products
- cart.php, rate.php : Contain the cart and rating code
- splash.html : The basic splash page
- login.php : The login code
- admin.php : For the admin login

I have tried to stick to two colors as far as possible.
