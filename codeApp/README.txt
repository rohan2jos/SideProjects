This is a barebones Angular JS/MEAN Stack app that I am creating as a playground for our Side Project.

I will keep experimenting on this for sometime

V1.1. Barebones app created with basic routing using routeProvider
V1.2. Changed the folder structure, will need to improve the structure

V1.4. Added some images and the W3.CSS file
V1.5. Added a floating button that has 'no functionality'
V1.6. Added zoom to the images.  However, there is no angular logic backing this functionlity
	so for now, the image zoom will always display the first image

V1.8. Added a modal for login
V1.10. Removed Login modal. Added jumbotron and cards in about.  Added a page for login and the loginController. Login function in the login controller only recognizes clicks
